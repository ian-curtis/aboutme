# About Me

My name is **Ian Curtis** and I currently have two dogs, Sadie (a *goldendoodle*) and Finn (an aussiedoodle). My favorite hobby is probably reading but I also love playing instruments and recording music.

My favorite musical artist right now is Imagine Dragons. My favorite tracks of theirs are as follows:
1. Whatever It Takes
2. Bad Liar
3. Follow You
4. Radioactive
5. Warriors

## Extra Credit

### My Favorite Colors

* Teal
  * This color is the perfect mix of blue and green that isn't ugly.
* Grey
  * It might seem bland, but it's the ultimate matching color. Every other color looks good with it and I respect that.
* Ruby Red
  * My first car was a ruby red and there is something unqiue about a good dark red that just works.

### An Image

Below, I have put an image of my two dogs, Sadie and Finn. They are both begging for a treat.

### My Favorite Video

I think my current favorite video is [this Vsauce video on counting past infinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrU9YDoXE88). It boggles my mind 
every time I watch it (and I've watched it many times).

### Some Code

Here is the code for a (rather useless) Python function to compute the mean between some inputted numbers:

```
def take_avg(list_nums):
  sum_of_nums = sum(list_nums)
  avg_of_nums = sum_of_nums / len(list_nums)
  return avg_of_nums

take_avg([10, 23, 28, 4, 13, 4, 9])
```

True, I could just use `numpy` for this.

```
import numpy as np

avg_of_nums = np.mean([10, 23, 28, 4, 13, 4, 9])
```
